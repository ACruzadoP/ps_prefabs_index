If you have ever worked as a Player Support Agent, I'm pretty sure you have noticed that all the prefabs tend to be stored in the same spreadsheet. This presents a few inconveniences that cause the list to never stop increasing. The most important inconveniences are:
 <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It takes too long for the Team Leads to go through all the prefabs in order to remove the unnecesary ones.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. It's very likely to end up entering duplicate as well as unnecesary prefabs. 
 <br /> <br />
With that said, at certain point the PS agents have to spend long time in order to find the prefab that works better for a specific situation. When I realized about this issue, I thought it would be a good idea to create an Index of prefabs and these two scripts allowed me to find the prefab I needed as fast as possible. In order to make them work, the spreadsheet needs to have these two sheets:
 <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Index: On this sheet you will have two columns (not necessarily the first ones):<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Categories.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Index of prefabs. The name of the prefabs should be listed under the category they belong to. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Database: On this sheet you will have the following columns:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The 1st column should be a copy of the column 1b.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The 2nd column should be for the English prefabs.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The following columns should be used for the remaining languages. 
   <br /> <br />
As soon as the spreadsheet is ready to be used. Two buttons should be added to the sheet where the Index is located. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Scroll: If you click on a category, located on the column 1a, using the button will save you scrolling time - by taking you to the row where the prefabs, that belong to that category, are located. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Search: If you tap on a prefab, located on the column 1b, using the button will take you to the sheet where the Database is located and will scroll to the row where that specific prefab is located. 
   <br /> <br />
A guide will be recorded and provided by me as soon as possible.
